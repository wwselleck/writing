The highlight here is obviously the themeing, which is bright and colorful and packed with Pokemon. This makes it extra sad that there are only 2 total boards in this game, the same as the Pokemon Pinball on the Gameboy Color.

As for the gameplay, it's pinball, with the extra gimmick of catching Pokemon every once in awhile. As far as I can tell, catching Pokemon doesn't serve any purpose other than to fill up the Pokedex, which is fun in its own right, but not enough to make me excited when I catch a new one. The few minigames included are fun enough, but get tiring after playing each a few times.

I think even just one or two more boards would've made this game significantly more fun, but it's still alright as-is.
